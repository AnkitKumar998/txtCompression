Steps to build Huffman Tree:
The input to the algorithm is the array of characters in the text file.
The frequency of occurrences of each character in the file is calculated.
Struct array is created where each element includes the character along with their frequencies. They are stored in a priority queue (min-heap), where the elements are compared using their frequencies.
To build the Huffman tree, two elements with minimum frequency are extracted from the min-heap.
The two nodes are added to the tree as left and right children to a new root node which contains the frequency equal to the sum of two frequencies. A lower frequency character is added to the left child node and the higher frequency character into the right child node. 
The root node is then again added back to the priority queue.
Repeat from step 4 until there is only one element left in the priority queue.
Finally, the tree’s left and right edges are numbered 0 and 1, respectively. For each leaf node, the entire tree is traversed, and the corresponding 1 and 0 are appended to their code until a leaf node is encountered.
Once we have the unique codes for each unique character in the text, we can replace the text characters with their codes. These codes will be stored in bit-by-bit form, which will take up less space than text.
